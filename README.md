### Visualization of popular multimedia compression algorithms

This application is meant to be an educational aid to understanding 5 different popular compression 
algorithms found in multimedia applications. For arithmetic encoding, there is a step by step 
visualization tool to help students walk through the arithmetic encoding process. For huffman encoding, 
the resulting tree is given for an inputted source message. Adaptive flavours are also included in 
this tool as they are more suitable algorithms for real-time compression common in multimedia programs.
